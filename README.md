# ‚ú®üêà‚Äç‚¨õ `sepruko`

Hiya, I'm Nat Sepruko! You can just call me Nat. I'm a hobby developer of 6+
years, and I love to write code using a variety of programming languages.

## Q & A

1. What's your favorite programming language?

   Definitely [Zig]. I enjoy its C-like performance and low-level applications,
   but with a modernized approach to the build system, types, and memory
   management.

   _You could of course manage memory the same way you do in C, but why would
   you?_

2. Frontend or backend development?

   <!-- cspell:disable-next-line -->

   ¬øPor qu√© no los dos? <sub>(Why not both?)</sub>

3. What's your preferred operating system for development?

   [Gentoo]. I tried it out via [WSL] and fell in love with the configuration
   setup and [portage][gentoo-portage].

   _If I had to complain about something, it's having to recompile `gcc` when it
   updates (if I want an optimized build for my local machine)._

## Interests

I have several interests, one of which is _obviously_ programming. I also enjoy
tinkering with Android devices, including my `komodo`, `solios` and `p3s`.
Refereeing football ‚öΩ matches is also something I have a lot of fun with!
